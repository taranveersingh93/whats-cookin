## Abstract: 
This is a recipe website that uses the fetch API to display information about a variety of recipes. This web app also allows searching recipes by name, ingredients, tags, and allows users to save their favorite recipes! This is a collaborative project, created to ensure cohesive usage of newly learned concepts such as Rest APIs, and array prototype methods to implement CRUD functionality. 
### User Stories: 
- Users can click on a recipe to view more information.
- Users are able to save and delete recipes from the main landing page as well as from inside the recipe display.
- Users are able to view a graph representing which recipes are most popular across multiple users. 
### Technical pointers: 
- The data for this website is fetched from an API endpoint. 
- Recipe display is responsive across, small, medium, and large screens, including cell phones and tablets. 
- Testing was implemented with the Mocha framework and Chai library. 


## Installation Instructions 
- In order for this application to function, it will require accessing both our backend server repository as well as our front-end repository. 


### Client App Setup
- Open a separate tab in your terminal using `command T`
- Fork [this](https://github.com/taranveersingh93/whats-cookin) repository. 
- Clone it to your local machine using the command: `git clone git@github.com:lauraguerra1/whats-cookin.git`.
- Run the command: `cd whats-cookin`
- Run the command: `npm install`
- Run the command: `npm start`
- Once the modules have finished compiling, enter `http://localhost:8080/` into your browser to see the live web page.

## Learning Goals:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using Test Driven Development.
- Make network requests (using fetch API) to create, read, update, and destroy data. 
  - (Apply newly learned concepts including GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE network requests)
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. 
- Implement the use of a project board, task delegation tickets, and thorough code reviews.
